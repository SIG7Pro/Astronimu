# Astronimu / Astromina Engine Developer Diary
This is a simple quote on quote developer diary meant to talk about stuff. Simillar to a blog since this repo isn't private.
## Made in HaxeFlixel!
[HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com) is a cool thingie which is essentially a cool game engine thing. Its built on Haxe, OpenFL, and Flixel, pretty cool right?
## Diary Entries

Diary Entries will be kept from newest to oldest.
### Day 3-4-5 / Thursday, 18 May, 2023 + Friday, 19 May 2023.
#### Part 2 / Days 3/4

I accidentally missed my quote on quote deadline of writing this before the day ended. So I'll write for three days instead of two and parts instead of halves. My sister kinda quote on quote angrily lectured me about school crap. They always assume I don't care or I simply don't wanna do it but in reality I'm just way too slow with school stuff. I've also made these parts into sub-sub-sub-categories. (How do I explain this??)

However, you are most likely reading this to see the Game Dev stuff, not crap about my personal life. I'll hurry this up since I really have to go in a bit but I'll show some game assets I've made so far!

Pixel Arrows (The colors for these were used to form the basis for the normal arrows.)

I've made pixel notes for the circle thingies, which I might call twirl mode notes. But I can't find them. I'm also making normal bar notes but I'll show those when I can.

You may have also noticed I added a [project.xml](project.xml) file! We're getting somewhere, baby! Hahaha! 

I'll hop off and hopefully return for part 3!

#### Part 1 / Day 3

This was meant to be written yesterday but I simply couldn't write in this diary as I was planning on doing. If I were to be fair, I'll consider this first half to be Day 3's half then I'll write another half later. (It is 12:02A as of writing.) So basically, I wasn't able to do anything today for the game unfortunately. I doubt I would be able to if I were to be honest, but I'm not sure.

Yesterday's talk about coding and getting a friend to join most likely won't do very well ~~since I think Emily * *might* * be mad at me since I unintentionally made another friend feel uncomfortable "yesterday"... I'll have to eventually respond to her angry message but not now... In the meanwhile, I do have guilt and shame, I'm not going to talk about it.~~

Hopefully after I get this commit out for the DevDiary, I can add some folders and a project.xml file. It won't be much now but its the thought that counts. My main goal for this is to be able to make ***at least one play style*** that is functional.

I'm going to hop off now and meet y'all in part two. (12:08 AM)

### Day 2 / Tuesday, 16 May, 2023.
As of writing, I haven't gotten time to work on the game, but hey, not all developers can work on their games every day!

I've been assisting with a mod for a game known as Friday Night Funkin', which meant I was busy for the technical stuff. I think it might be getting released or tomorrow, I'm not sure.

Modding other games aside, looking at some code for tweening sprites seems pretty hard to do, and considering this is a rhythm game meant for three playstyles means there's gonna have to be a lot of tweening and spawning to do; yikes. I've been considering getting my friend Emily/Kirby (said person has two names, make fun of her) to help but she's probably busy and I'm too scared to tell her my concept. Maybe in the summer months she might be availible, who knows?

Code wise, that's kinda in a pickle; how about music-wise? Well I don't know anyone who would wanna make music, or at least not anymore, so I might use some royalty-free music from Newgrounds as placeholders.

For graphics, I'll make those on my own times, that is going to hopefully be the easiest part of this.

#### Special Thanks! (Day 2)
Flez is cool, I don't have a reason for giving him thanks.

(Fun fact, this so far is a day where I've used the preview tool the least, which is twice!)


### Day 1 / Monday, 15 May, 2023.
I finally got the dev diary set up, and I'm typing stuff in it! Cool! I'm currently typing stuff and hoping it looks good, I'm not a proffessional at writing these kinds of things. üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

Since you probably came here expecting something to read, have some story behind the game's creation! Around five days ago I think (the 10th of May), I saw a video about rhythm games and it kinda inspired me to make my own rhythm game. 
I ended up making some concepts, and I showed some friends, the Game Dev League server's #gamedev-chat channel, and the [Haxe server](https://discordapp.com/invite/rqEBAgF)'s #development channel. I might share said concepts tomorrow, Discord was lagging my PC as of writing this and I haven't saved the concepts to my computer.

Approximately three or four days later, I created the repo.

The name Astronima Engine came from me realizing I needed a name for it, and that was the first name that came to mind, mostly as a placeholder. The Astronimu name came from me wanting to combine the name Astronima Engine and Osu. I initially planned to call it ~~Astru~~, but I think that name belongs to a Russian medicare brand or something, all I know is that I couldn't quite use the name. I tried using one of those combine word sites but it didn't give me the best results. All of a sudden, I came up with a name that sounded good, "Astrominu" that later became Astronimu as I was fixing stuff with the name.

I can't decide what I should start working on now, but maybe I could try setting it up on my Windows laptop then push the code to here. I don't know much about how VSC works so bear with me. :shipit:
I might look to see if the fonts I like have a download link on the internet so I can actually use them in-game.
