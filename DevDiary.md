# Astronimu / Astromina Engine Developer Diary
This is a simple quote on quote developer diary meant to talk about stuff. Simillar to a blog since this repo isn't private.
## Made in HaxeFlixel!
[HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com) is a cool thingie which is essentially a cool game engine thing. Its built on Haxe, OpenFL, and Flixel, pretty cool right?

Diary Entries will be kept from newest to oldest, considering there's only one noted day, there is no need to really put this text here.



### Day 1 / Monday, 15 May, 2023.
I finally got the dev diary set up, and I'm typing stuff in it! Cool! I'm currently typing stuff and hoping it looks good, I'm not a proffessional at writing these kinds of things. üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

Since you probably came here expecting something to read, have some story behind the game's creation! Around five days ago I think (the 10th of May), I saw a video about rhythm games and it kinda inspired me to make my own rhythm game. 
I ended up making some concepts, and I showed some friends, the Game Dev League server's #gamedev-chat channel, and the [Haxe server](https://discordapp.com/invite/rqEBAgF)'s #development channel. I might share said concepts tomorrow, Discord was lagging my PC as of writing this and I haven't saved the concepts to my computer.

Approximately three or four days later, I created the repo.

The name Astronima Engine came from me realizing I needed a name for it, and that was the first name that came to mind, mostly as a placeholder. The Astronimu name came from me wanting to combine the name Astronima Engine and Osu. I initially planned to call it ~~Astru~~, but I think that name belongs to a Russian medicare brand or something, all I know is that I couldn't quite use the name. I tried using one of those combine word sites but it didn't give me the best results. All of a sudden, I came up with a name that sounded good, "Astrominu" that later became Astronimu as I was fixing stuff with the name.

I can't decide what I should start working on now, but maybe I could try setting it up on my Windows laptop then push the code to here. I don't know much about how VSC works so bear with me. :shipit:
I might look to see if the fonts I like have a download link on the internet so I can actually use them in-game.
#### Special Thanks! (Day 1)
